# Resonite Storage Browser

This is a simple in-browser inventory viewer for Resonite. The goal for this app is to make it easier to find out what is eating so much storage space in a given account.

## Instructions

This website uses a JSON file produced by Resonite. In order to use this tool, you need to get your "Record Usage JSON" file.

To obtain this file you need to login to your Resonite account and send the Resonite bot the message `/requestRecordUsageJSON`. After you submit this command, Resonite will email you shortly after with an attachment that contains the file you will need.

Once you have your file, continue to [the website](https://armored-dragon.github.io/Resonite-Inventory-Viewer/index) and select the `.json` file in the file browser input, and this app should take care of the rest.
